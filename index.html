            <h1>Info</h1>
            <p>HackGT, in partnership with BME Learning Commons, is excited to host our first ever Healthtech Hackathon!</p>

            <p>Students from the Atlanta area, of all majors, are welcome to apply.</p>

            <p>With our resources -- mentors, workshops, and a place to work -- we look forward to seeing your ideas come to life.</p>

            <p>During this event, you will be working with teams of up to four people in order to create a minimum viable product or a prototype. Your project can be a either hardware or software focused, or a good mix of the two.</p>

Inter-hospital communication and global analytics connect the world, paving a way to a future in which everyone can receive the treatment that they need.</p>
